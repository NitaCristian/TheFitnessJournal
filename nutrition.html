                A very low carbohydrate and high protein and fat diet is known as the ketogenic diet. The goal is to
                trick the body into going into a state of ketosis, when it uses fat for fuel instead of the body's
                typical supply of glucose and other carbs high in glucose.

                Veganism is a diet and way of life which forbids the use of any animal products, including dairy, honey,
                and eggs. When practiced correctly, the vegan diet can be sustaining, filling, and have a variety of
                health benefits, such as reducing body weight, blood pressure, and the prevalence of cardiovascular
                disease.

                The most fundamental and straightforward eating style is the whole food diet. It entails consuming food
                in its natural state with little processing. As processed foods, sweets, fast foods, and fried foods are
                removed from your plate and you return to simple, clean eating, a whole food diet tends to improve your
                health and vitality.
