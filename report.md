# Introduction

## Purpose

What is the essential story begin told by your website?

My website's objective is to offer a wide range of articles about fitness, going from basic exercises for different muscle groups to recipes for best nutrition, to science based information about our body and how it works.

The target audience is absolutely anyone, from novice to experienced lifters. I believe that every person should work out and live a proper life.

From my experience I want everybody to have a chance and a starting point in lifting.

## Structure

What type of structure did you choose to implement?

The "Home" page features a little bit of information from every other page, sort of like an introduction to other sections of the website. Just like an online magazine would do, the first section features trending news that are most engaged by our readers. then a section about training which shows the types of exercises someone could do to either build muscle or lose weight. last section presents latest recipes for the nutrition category.

The "News" page features the same section of trending news and then articles grouped by their specific category like science, nutrition training. Every section contains the latest 3 articles for that category and a button with the option to load more.

The "Training" page shows a bunch of exercises grouped by muscle groups. Each section shows the best exercises that would work these muscles.

The nutrition page features recipes, information about diets and supplements .

in the about page the user will find info about the website, some frequently asked questions a contact form and the location of the headquarters of the magazine.

# Inspiration

1. Part of my inspiration for choosing the theme of the website as a fitness magazine was my personal experience lifting weight and working out.

2. Other inspiration for the creating of the website were the websites MyFitnessPal and BodyBuilding.com which contain a lot of great resources including most of the content on my website.

3. 

# Accessibility

To grant people with a range of abilities access and opportunity, the Web must be accessible.
The website follows accessibility principles presented in this article by the W3C organization (https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/). 

1. The Fitness Report website displays text alternatives for non-text content, for example every image has a short equivalent text and every form control and input has labels.
These alternatives have the function to provide an equivalent user experience to people with disabilities and can be read aloud to them, enlarged to desired text sizes and displayed on braille devices. The webpage is constructed using semantic html. Semantic elements are easier to develop and understand but provide useful meaning to the user. better defining the different sections and layout of web pages. It makes web pages more informative and adaptable, allowing browsers and search engines to better interpret content

2. Another way in which the website is accessible to people with disabilities is that the content is easy to see because the different color combinations employed by the website make it easy to distinguish between foreground, background, and content and provides sufficient contrast. Images and text is resizable and responsive which makes it easy to read and see on different screens and font sizes. Provide sufficient color contrast

3. A very important accessibility principle is that users can easily navigate the website, find content, and determine where they are. Pages have clear titles and are organized using descriptive section headings and There is more than one way to find relevant pages within a set of web pages, users are able to access articles from multiple pages.
Also, the content that appears is predictable, every page containing the same navigation and footer and at the same place each time with same titles and content. This make users quickly learn the functionality and navigation on a website.

# Usability

Usability is the ease with which users may interact with a website.

1. Readability: The content of the website is spaced out. Every element has room around to breath which helps the user by lettings him focus on what's important and not clutter vision. The style is minimalist and modern. my website is designed in such a way that it is both simple yet contains all the necessary information one would search on a fitness magazine. the design makes it appealing being modern and minimalist and it is very easy to a user to find and read content without cluttering their vision.

2. Performance: Slow websites loose visitors. Your content should be easy to read, so that it doesnâ€™t confuse or frustrate. Many website load mb of data, ads, and overall junk which slow down a website and frustrate visitors. and potentially lose them. I don't find anything worse than a website that still loads after 10 seconds of entering it. 

3. Responsiveness: Mobile traffic is more important than ever, so your site needs to work well on all devices. My website us usable by every device. It is responsive and can adapt to desktop, table and mobile to give the same experience to everyone. it is one of the most important aspects of a website because it needs to be ready for every possible occasion. Mobile traffic is more important than ever and this would be great to attract a ton of audience .

# Evaluation

## Evaluation I

In my opinion, I have improved in creating the mark-up of a website using HTML. From the previous group project I can definitely say that I now understand better the HTML syntax and elements and how to use them to create a fairly complex website. I also improved in the CSS section of website creating and I now understand more and how to use css better. I learn more about animation and layout using flexbox or grid. I was also faster at designing the wireframes and mock-ups of the website because I got to practice more with figma, but also I have more and more ideas all the time that I can implement. I know my limitations of what I can achieve but I also try to get creative and manage to improve my design a lot more.

## Evaluation II

I could've definitely improve on UX when making the website. I personally would have liked to create a more interactive website, more colorful and responsive. The world of CSS animation is fairly complex and I managed to just get a feeling of how to create the most basic of them, but I fell like this would have added to the experience that a real user would feel when visiting myu website. Using a database and a templating engine would have helped me a ton. Instead of writing mark-up for every article, fix one and have to repair every single one of them is very frustrating, but a database of all the article and a templating engine such has Hnadlebars would have helped me save some time. I would have like to spend more time on the project and not procrastinate as much as i did.
