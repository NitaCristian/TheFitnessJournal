# Introduction

## Purpose

What is the essential story begin told by your website?

My website's objective is to offer a wide range of articles about fitness, going from basic exercises for different muscle groups to recipies for best nutrition, to science based information about our body and how it works.

The target audience is absolutely anyone, from novice to experienced lifters. I believe that every person should work out and live a proper life.

From my experience I want everybody to have a chance and a starting point in lifting.

## Structure

What type of structure did you choose to implement?

The "Home" page features a little bit of information from every other page, sort of like an introduction to other sections of the website. Just like an online magazine would do, the first section features trending news that are most engaged by our readers. then a section about training which shows the types of exercises someone could do to either build muscle or lose weight. last section presents latest recipes for the nustrition category.

The "News" page feaures the same section of trending news and then articles grouped by their specific category like scinece, nutrition training. Every section containes the latest 3 articles for that category and a button with the option to load more.

The "Trainig" page shows a bunch of exercises grouopd by muscle groups. Each section shows the best exercises that would work these muscles.

The nustrition page features recipes, information about diets and supplements .

in the about page the user will find info about the website, some frequesti asked questi a contact form and the location of the headquarters of the magazine.

# Inspiration

1. Part of my inspiration for choosing the theme of the website as a fitness magazine was my personal experience lifting weight and working out.

2. Other inspiration for the creating of the website were the websites MyFitnessPal and BodyBuilding.com which contain a lot of great resources including most of the content on my website.

3. 

# Accessibility

To grant people with a range of abilities access and opportunity, the Web must be accessible.
The website follows accessibility principles presented in this article by the W3C organization (https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/). 

1. The Fitness Report website displays text alternatives for non-text content, for example every image has a short equivalent text and every form control and input has labels.
These alternatives have the function to provide an equivalent user experince to people with disabilities and can be read aloud to them, enlarged to desired text sizes and displayed on braille devices. The webpage is constructued using semantic html. Semantic elements are easier to develop and understand but provide useful mening to the user. better defining the different sections and layout of web pages. It makes web pages more informative and adaptable, allowing browsers and search engines to better interpret content

2. Another way in which the website is accesible to people with disabilities is that the content is easy to see because the different color combinations empleyoed by the websiet make it easy to distinguish between foreground, background, and content and provides sufficient contrast. Images and text is resizable and responsive which makes it easy to read and see on different screesn and font sizes. Provide sufficient color contrast

3. A very important accessibility principle is that users can easily navigate the website, find content, and determine where they are. Pages have clear titles and are organized using descriptive section headings and There is more than one way to find relevant pages within a set of web pages, users beging able to access articles from multiple pages.
Also, the content that appears is predictible, every page containing the same navigation and footer and at the same place each time with same titles and content. This make users quickly learn the functionality and navigation on a website.

# Usability

Usability is the ease with which users may interact with a website.

1. Readability: The content of the website is spaged out. Every element has room arount to breath which helps the user by lettings him focus on what's important and not clutter vision. The style is minimalist and modemr. my website is desingd in such a way that it is both simple yet contais all the neccesay information one would search on a fitness magazine. the design makes it appealing being modern and minimalist and it is verry easy to a user to find and read content without cluttering their vision.

2. Performance: Slow websites loose visitors. Your content should be easy to read, so that it doesnâ€™t confuse or frustrate. Many website load mb of data, ads, and overall junk which slow doan a website and frustrate visitors. and potentialy lose them. I don't find anything worse than a website that still loads aftrer 10 seconds of entering it. 

3. Responsiveness: Mobile traffic is more important than ever, so your site needs to work well on all devices. My website us usable by every device. It is reponsive and can adapt to desktop, table and mobile to give the same experice to everyone. it is one of the most importat aspects of a website because it needs to be ready for every possible ocasion. Mobile traffic is more important than ever and this would be great to attract a ton of audiece .

# Evaluation

## Evaluation I

In my opinion, I have improved in creating the mark-up of a website using HTML. From the previous group project I can definetly say that I now understand better the HTML syntax and elements and how to use them to create a fairly complex website. I also improved in the CSS section of website creating and I now understand more and how to use css better. I learn more about animation and layout using flexbox or grid. I was also faster at designing the wireframes and mock-ups of the website because I got to pracice more with figma, but also I have more and more ideas all the time that I can implement. I know my limitations of what I can achieve but I also try to get creative and manage to improve my design a lot more.

## Evaluation II

I could've definelty improve on UX when making the website. I personally would have liked to create a more interactive website, more coolroful and responsive. The world of CSS animation is fairly complex and I managed to just get a feeling of how to create the most basic of them, but I fell like this would have added to the experince that a real usre would feel when visiting myu website. Using a database and a templating engine would have helped me a ton. Instead of writing mark-up for every article, fix one and have to reapir every single one of them is very frustrating, but a database of all the article and a templating engine such has Hnadlebars would have helped me save some time. I would have like to spend more time on the project and not procrasitnate as much as i did.
