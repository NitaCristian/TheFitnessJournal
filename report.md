The "Home" page features a little bit of information from every other page, sort of like an introduction to other sections of the website. Just like an online magazine would do, the first section features trending news that are most engaged by our readers. then a section about training which shows the types of exercises someone could do to either build muscle or lose weight. last section presents latest recipes for the nustrition category.

The "News" page feaures the same section of trending news and then articles grouped by their specific category like scinece, nutrition training. Every section containes the latest 3 articles for that category and a button with the option to load more.

The "Trainig" page shows a bunch of exercises grouopd by muscle groups. Each section shows the best exercises that would work these muscles.
