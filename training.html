                <article>
                    <h3>Bench Press</h3>
                    <img src="images/barbell-bench-press-830x467.jpg" alt="Woman doing bench press" loading="lazy">
                    <p>
                        The barbell bench press is a traditional exercise that is well-liked throughout all weight
                        lifting
                        communities. The bench press is a fundamental chest exercise in almost every fitness regimen,
                        from
                        bodybuilders to powerlifters. The pectoralis major is the main muscle worked by bench pressing
                        (your
                        chest).

                    <h3>Chest Fly</h3>
                    <img src="images/chest-fly-830x467.jpg" alt="Man doing chest fly" loading="lazy">
                    <p>
                        Cables are unbeatable when it comes to fly variants. They enable constant tension throughout the
                        entire range of motion of the activity. After your presses, perform your flyes as either your
                        first
                        isolation exercise or your last activity of the workout.

                    <h3>Lat Pulldown</h3>
                    <img src="images/lat-pull-down-830x467.jpg" alt="Man doing lat pulldown" loading="lazy">
                    <p>
                        It's terrific for growing muscle since it gives the lats a wider range of motion and more time
                        under
                        tension. On these, slow down the pace of each rep, squeeze firmly at the bottom, and allow a
                        good
                        stretch at the top.

                    <p>
                        The traditional seated row, in contrast to every free-weight version here, keeps tension
                        constant
                        throughout the whole exercise. Additionally, many gyms feature a variety of handles that you may
                        use
                        to create a variety of wide and narrow grips.

                    <h3>Dips</h3>
                    <img src="images/triceps-dip-830x467.jpg" alt="Man doing dip" loading="lazy">
                    <p>
                        Dips are a well-known standalone mass-builder. Dips work the triceps more than the chest, so
                        maintain as much upright posture as you can. Maintain a straight back and keep your elbows
                        tucked
                        down close to your sides.

                    <p>
                        The short and long heads of the biceps are similarly worked out by the typical shoulder-width
                        curl.
                        When you can really push yourself with weight, start your biceps workout with heavy curls.
                        Select a
                        weight that will allow you to complete 6-8 repetitions for a little more of a strength stimulus.

                    <p>
                        Curls performed with a palms-facing or neutral grip substantially engage the brachialis in
                        addition
                        to the biceps. By "raising" your biceps from underneath, a larger brachialis can make your
                        entire
                        arm bigger.

                    <p>
                        This exercise is widely regarded as the classic triceps burnout technique for good reason. It is
                        simple to do, effectively targets the lateral head, and lends itself well to dropsets.

                    <h3>Squats</h3>
                    <img src="images/barbell-back-squat-legs-830x467.jpg" alt="Man doing squat" loading="lazy">
                    <p>
                        Because they are the most difficult leg exercise you can perform, squats are king. They engage
                        every
                        muscle in the lower body and have been found to increase the production of the hormones that
                        help
                        build muscle. In fact, it has been demonstrated that squatting before practicing curls
                        dramatically
                        increases arm strength!
                    </p>
                </article>

                    <h3>Leg Press</h3>
                    <img src="images/leg-press-830x467.jpg" alt="Man doing leg press" loading="lazy">
                    <p>
                        The leg press enables a range of foot positions to stimulate the hamstrings, glutes, outer
                        quads, or
                        inner quads. Take cautious not to lower the sled too much, though! 3-4 sets of 8-12 repetitions
                        are
                        a safe bet.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Lateral Raise</h3>
                    <img src="images/lateral-raise-830x467.jpg" alt="Woman doing lateral raise" loading="lazy">
                    <p>
                        Although it's one of the best and most well-liked isolation exercises in the gym, this exercise
                        is
                        trickier to master than it first appears. The two cues to lead with your elbows and to only
                        proceed
                        down until your arms are around 30 degrees out from your sides are usually helpful for
                        beginners.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Rear Deltoid Machine</h3>
                    <img src="images/rear-delt-machine.jpg" alt="Man working rear delt" loading="lazy">
                    <p>
                        Your posterior deltoids are developed using the rear delt fly machine, which develops your
                        shoulder
                        muscles. The rear delt fly machine offers far more stability than free weight exercises like the
                        bent over reverse fly.
