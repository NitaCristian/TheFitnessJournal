            <h2>Chest and Back</h2>

            <article>
                <h3>Bench Press</h3>
                <img src="images/barbell-bench-press-830x467.jpg" alt="Woman doing bench press" loading="lazy">
                <p>
                    The barbell bench press is a traditional exercise that is well-liked throughout all weight lifting
                    communities. The bench press is a fundamental chest exercise in almost every fitness regimen, from
                    bodybuilders to powerlifters. The pectoralis major is the main muscle worked by bench pressing (your
                    chest).
                </p>

                <h3>Chest Fly</h3>
                <img src="images/chest-fly-830x467.jpg" alt="Man doing chest fly" loading="lazy">
                <p>
                    Cables are unbeatable when it comes to fly variants. They enable constant tension throughout the
                    entire range of motion of the activity. After your presses, perform your flyes as either your first
                    isolation exercise or your last activity of the workout.
                </p>

                <h3>Lat Pulldown</h3>
                <img src="images/lat-pull-down-830x467.jpg" alt="Man doing lat pulldown" loading="lazy">
                <p>
                    It's terrific for growing muscle since it gives the lats a wider range of motion and more time under
                    tension. On these, slow down the pace of each rep, squeeze firmly at the bottom, and allow a good
                    stretch at the top.

                <h3>Seated Lat Row</h3>
                <img src="images/seated-row-830x467.jpg" alt="Man doing seated row" loading="lazy">
                <p>
                    The traditional seated row, in contrast to every free-weight version here, keeps tension constant
                    throughout the whole exercise. Additionally, many gyms feature a variety of handles that you may use
                    to create a variety of wide and narrow grips.

            <h2>Biceps and Triceps</h2>

            <article>
                <h3>Dips</h3>
                <img src="images/triceps-dip-830x467.jpg" alt="Man doing dip" loading="lazy">
                <p>
                    Dips are a well-known standalone mass-builder. Dips work the triceps more than the chest, so
                    maintain as much upright posture as you can. Maintain a straight back and keep your elbows tucked
                    down close to your sides.
                </p>

                <h3>Barbell Curl</h3>
                <img src="images/standing-barbell-curl-830x467.jpg" alt="Man doing barbell curl" loading="lazy">
                <p>
                    The short and long heads of the biceps are similarly worked out by the typical shoulder-width curl.
                    When you can really push yourself with weight, start your biceps workout with heavy curls. Select a
                    weight that will allow you to complete 6-8 repetitions for a little more of a strength stimulus.
                </p>

                <h3>Hammer Curl</h3>
                <img src="images/rope-hammer-curl-830x467.jpg" alt="Man doing hammer curl" loading="lazy">
                <p>
                    Curls performed with a palms-facing or neutral grip substantially engage the brachialis in addition
                    to the biceps. By "raising" your biceps from underneath, a larger brachialis can make your entire
                    arm bigger.
                </p>

                <h3>Cable Push-Down</h3>
                <img src="images/cable-rope-pushdown-830x467.jpg" alt="Woman doing cable push-down" loading="lazy">
                <p>
                    This exercise is widely regarded as the classic triceps burnout technique for good reason. It is
                    simple to do, effectively targets the lateral head, and lends itself well to dropsets.

            <h2>Legs and Delts</h2>

            <article>
                <h3>Squats</h3>
                <img src="images/barbell-back-squat-legs-830x467.jpg" alt="Man doing squat" loading="lazy">
                <p>
                    Because they are the most difficult leg exercise you can perform, squats are king. They engage every
                    muscle in the lower body and have been found to increase the production of the hormones that help
                    build muscle. In fact, it has been demonstrated that squatting before practicing curls dramatically
                    increases arm strength!
                </p>

                <h3>Leg Press</h3>
                <img src="images/leg-press-830x467.jpg" alt="Man doing leg press" loading="lazy">
                <p>
                    The leg press enables a range of foot positions to stimulate the hamstrings, glutes, outer quads, or
                    inner quads. Take cautious not to lower the sled too much, though! 3-4 sets of 8-12 repetitions are
                    a safe bet.
                </p>

                <h3>Lateral Raise</h3>
                <img src="images/lateral-raise-830x467.jpg" alt="Woman doing lateral raise" loading="lazy">
                <p>
                    Although it's one of the best and most well-liked isolation exercises in the gym, this exercise is
                    trickier to master than it first appears. The two cues to lead with your elbows and to only proceed
                    down until your arms are around 30 degrees out from your sides are usually helpful for beginners.

                <h3>Rear Deltoid Machine</h3>
                <img src="images/rear-delt-machine.jpg" alt="Man working rear delt" loading="lazy">
                <p>
                    Your posterior deltoids are developed using the rear delt fly machine, which develops your shoulder
                    muscles. The rear delt fly machine offers far more stability than free weight exercises like the
                    bent over reverse fly.
