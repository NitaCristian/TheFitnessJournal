            <p>
                The Fitness Report is a small online publication started by a group of passionate people.
                Our goal is to deliver quality and science-based information to a broad audience in an effort to change
                minds and empower people to lead better, healthier, and more satisfying lives.
                <br><br>
                It all started with when people at our local gym kept asking us for advice on exercises and nutrition.
                We then decided to spread our knowledge with a broader audience, but also expand it with the help of
                people around the world.
                <br><br>
                Our readers may come from different backgrounds with different opportunities, but we are sure that we
                have everything for everybody.
