    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        The website's objective is to offer a wide range of articles about fitness, going from basic exercises and
        recipes, to science based information about our body and how to develop it properly.
        The target audience is absolutely anyone, from novice to experienced lifters. Some articles, such as basic
        training exercises or simple but nutritious recipes cater more to beginners as they need to know the
        fundamentals first before learning anything advance. But there are also articles aimed at more advanced lifters
        who need to take their lifting to the next level.
    </p>
    <h2>Structure</h2>
    <p>
        The "Home" page features a bit of information from every other page, like an introduction to other sections of
        the
        website. Just like an online magazine would do, the first section features trending news
        that are most engaged by our readers, then a section about training which shows what are the goals of the
        presented exercises like building muscle or losing weight. The last section presents the latest recipes for the
        nutrition category.
    </p>
    <p>
        The "News" page offers the same section of trending news and articles grouped by their category like science,
        nutrition, and training. Every section contains the latest 3 articles for that category.
    </p>
    <p>
        The "Training" page shows a bunch of exercises grouped by muscle groups. Each section shows the best exercises
        that would stimulate these muscles the most.
    </p>
    <p>
        The "Nutrition" page features a variety of recipes for smoothies, deserts and meals of various kinds. The next
        section is all about diets, more specifically a collection of diets with a picture and a summary for each. The
        last section presents supplements designed to enhance the training and give a performance boost.
        information about diets and supplements.
    </p>
    <p>
        The "About" page is the last page of the website with presents information about the company, a FAQ section, a
        contact form to let people write a letter to our enquiry team and the location of our headquarters.
    </p>
    <h1>Inspiration</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            One factor that contributed to my choice in choosing this theme for my website is my personal experience
            with weight lifting and working out.
        </li>
        <li>
            Another contributing aspect for the creating of the website were the websites MyFitnessPal and
            BodyBuilding.com which contain a lot of great resources including most of the content on my website.
        </li>
        <li>
            Promoting health and a healthy lifestyle is another element that contributed to the making of this website.
            I wanted to encourage and help people live a better life by providing the necessary information someone
            might need to start working out and maintain a nutritious and fulfilling life.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Accessibility</h1>
    <p>
        To grant people with a range of abilities access and opportunity, the Web must be accessible.
        The website follows accessibility principles presented in this article by the W3C organization
        (https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/).
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            The Fitness Report website displays text alternatives for non-text content, for example every image has a
            short equivalent text and every form control and input has labels. These alternatives have the function to
            provide an equivalent user experience to people with disabilities and can be read aloud to them, enlarged to
            desired text sizes and displayed on braille devices.
        </li>
        <li>
            Another way in which the website is accessible to people with disabilities is that the content is easy to
            see because the different color combinations employed by the website make it easy to distinguish between
            foreground, background, and content and provides sufficient contrast. Images and text is resizable and
            responsive which makes it easy to read and see on different screens and font sizes. Provide sufficient color
            contrast.
        </li>
        <li>
            A very important accessibility principle is that users can easily navigate the website, find content, and
            determine where they are. Pages have clear titles and are organized using descriptive section headings and
            there is more than one way to find relevant pages within a set of web pages. Also, the content that appears
            is predictable, every page containing the same navigation and footer and at the same place each time with
            same titles and content, which make users quickly learn the functionality and navigation on a website.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Usability</h1>
    <p>
        Usability is the ease with which users may interact with a website.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            The website's readability is one factor in usability. The website's content is dispersed. Every element has
            space around it to breathe, which helps the user by allowing him to concentrate on what is crucial and avoid
            having his vision cluttered. The design makes it appealing because it is contemporary and at the same time
            simple and contains all the information one would search for in a fitness magazine.
        </li>
        <li>
            Performance is a another element of usability because visitors always leave slow websites. Many websites
            load MBs
            of useless advertisements, images, and other clutter that slows down websites and irritates users. My
            website
            has been created to be efficient while still providing all the content a user has come to expect from it.
        </li>
        <li>
            The responsiveness of my website is the final usability factor. My site must function well across all
            platforms because mobile traffic is more significant than ever. To provide a consistent experience across
            desktop, tablet, and mobile platforms, the website is responsive.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Learning</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Learning CSS flexbox and CSS grid and when to use them. CSS flexbox and grid are powerful tools to
            layout elements on the page, but they have different use cases. Flexbox was made for one-dimensional layout,
            while grid was made for two-dimensional layout. But the most important property of CSS grid is that you can
            set the layout to be in a certain way which lets you create explicit responsive behavior, as opposed to CSS
            flexbox which is more flexible and not as strict.
        </li>
        <li>
            Learning CSS animations and CSS Pseudo elements. I used animations to add a fun CSS hover animation on the
            navigation links using transform and pseudo-elements. A css pseudo-element is a keyword that is added to a
            selector which lets you style a specific part of it. To create the animation I used the pseudo-element
            "::after" and created a box that slides above the link when the cursors hover it.

            In order to learn this, I watched a YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceNMP-aQkQ4 from the
            channel "Kevin Powell", in which he showcases different CSS hover effects.
        </li>
        <li>
            Learning JavaScript interaction with the dom. I learned to use the document object to select different
            elements from the DOM and then attribute them events or classes and enabled me to create a responsive
            navigation bar, a way to give the illusion of adding more articles by first hiding them and then show them
            when a button is clicked.

            In order to learn this, I used a YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At4B7A4GOPg from the
            YouTube channel "Web Dev Simplified", in which he shows this trick of toggling classes using javascript.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Evaluation</h1>

    <h2>Evaluation I</h2>
    <p>
        I believe I've made progress when it comes to using HTML to mark up websites.
        I can say with certainty that the previous group project has improved my understanding of the HTML syntax and
        elements, as well as how to use them to build a moderately complex website.
        I also improved in using CSS to create beautiful and stylish designs. I learned about animations and layout
        using flexbox or grid and how to use them effectively.
        Designing wireframes and mock-ups is another area I improved a lot, having more ideas and being able to
        implement them very fast in Figma.
    </p>

    <h2>Evaluation II</h2>
    <p>
        One area that I am not really happy with and I wish I would've improved more is CSS. Although I made some
        progress, I would've liked to create a more colorful and responsive website that has more interesting elements.
        The world of CSS animation is fairly complex and I managed to just get a feeling of how to create the most basic
        of them, but I fell like this would have added to the experience that a real user would feel when visiting my
        website.

        One other thing I would do differently another time is using a templating framework.
        Copying and pasting code around and checking to see if everything is the same is very frustrating and tiring.
        Using a templating engine like Handlebars would've helped me simplify and speed things up.
